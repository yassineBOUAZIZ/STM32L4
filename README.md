STM32L4 Drivers 	

This repository contains custom drivers developed for the STM32L476 microcontroller. 
These drivers were created with a focus on understanding the microcontroller's architecture and peripheral functionalities, as documented in the official reference manual and datasheet.

Drivers Implemented 

The repository includes the following drivers:

- ADC Driver
For analog-to-digital conversion, enabling the use of sensors and analog inputs.

- General Purpose Timer (GP Timer) Driver
For timer-based tasks like delays, PWM generation, and event counting.

- UART Driver
For serial communication using the Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) interface.

Resources Used

The drivers were developed with reference to the following official documents from STMicroelectronics:

- STM32L476 Reference Manual
This document provided in-depth information about the microcontroller's peripherals and registers, helping to configure hardware at the register level.

- STM32L476xx Datasheet
Used to understand the microcontroller's pinout, electrical characteristics, memory layout, and other device-specific details.

Purpose of the Project

This repository showcases the development of low-level drivers to enhance understanding of the STM32L476 microcontroller and its peripherals. It reflects my efforts to design, test, and implement efficient code for embedded systems.
